- Presentations: each week a presenter will give a talk summarizing the chapter and/or discussing practical applications of the topic at hand. 
- Data: Example datasets are stored in this folder to help facilitate practical applications! (For more info, please check out [Data/README.md](https://r4ds.github.io/bookclub-template/Data/))
- QandA: A collection of questions (and answers) on the chapters that come up during meetings (or between!)
