# R4DS [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) Book Club

A weekly reading group of R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan (2nd ed, WIP). Over the course of this book club, each member is going to make a package of personal functions!

This repo contains 2 main folders:

- Presentations: each week a presenter will give a talk summarizing the chapter and/or discussing practical applications of the topic at hand. 
- QandA: A collection of questions (and answers) on the chapters that come up during meetings (or between!)
