[["welcome.html", "R Packages Companion Welcome Parts of this Companion Suggested Order", " R Packages Companion R4DS Reading Group Last rendered: 2020-12-07 Welcome This book is a companion to R Packages, 2nd ed (WIP), by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan, and aims to support the reader through a full read-through of the book. It sets out learning objectives as well as collects common questions and answers. This Companion is also a work in progress, and being compiled alongside the first cohort(s) of the R4DS R Packages Book Club. Recordings for the accompanying presentations can be seen on this YouTube playlist. Parts of this Companion This box outlines some Learning Objectives for each chapter. For example: Identify reasons that you might write a package. Become familiar with all of the parts of an R package. This box denotes a question! This box means the supplied answer to the question is fuzzy and could use some work! We love PRs if youd like to help with documentation! Suggested Order We believe there is a different (idea-based) order in which this book should be read if reading every chapter (for example, by a book club) and our first cohort of the book club will be following the order described here!
